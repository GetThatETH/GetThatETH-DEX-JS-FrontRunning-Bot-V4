Introduction:

Cryptocurrency trading is filled with opportunities, especially for traders who can act quickly and decisively. One such strategy is front-running, where you execute a trade before a large transaction, expecting the price to shift as a result. This technique can be highly profitable, but identifying and reacting to front-running opportunities manually is challenging. That's where GetThatETH-DEX-JS-FrontRunning-Bot-V4 comes in—a powerful software tool designed to automate and optimize front-running strategies.

1. Understanding Front-Running:

Front-running is a trading strategy that involves placing a trade based on prior knowledge of a large upcoming transaction, which is expected to influence the price of a cryptocurrency. For example, if a large buy order is about to be executed, the price may rise, allowing you to buy beforehand and sell immediately after the transaction causes a price spike.

#CryptoArbitrage #DecentralizedFinance #DeFi #CryptoTrading #Blockchain #Cryptocurrency #Tr What is frontrunning? Whenever you use a decentralized exchange to swap tokens, the price of the token you buy increases slightly. This is called slippage and for most retail traders, slippage is barely even noticeable. Whale traders however, especially when they purchase highly illiquid tokens, can significantly change a token’s price.Frontrunning bots take advantage of this mechanic by beating out the trader on the gas fees, purchasing into a token at the lower price and then instantly selling them off at the higher price. In a block explorer, frontruns leave a clear trace with the trader’s transaction being sandwiched between the two frontrun transactions. #coding #frontrunningbot #javascript #tutorial #botv4 #dex #programming #configuration #learntocode #stepbystep #beginner
